## Changes to Make

So if you will try to run it directly after downloading it wont work. To make it workyou have to make some changes in code. We are trying to make this software to be used directly in exe. We use subprocess for that. You have to change all subprocess to os. After making all the changes run it and check it. If its working the help us by making more changes and contributing us. Dont make pull request in os. Convert it to subprocess and tell us in detail how to build it and change it to os.
